# About the project:

Kenken is a constraint satisification problem (CSP). The project's goal is to solve this puzzle for a user input size for the game. the program generates a valid random game, then the user chooses the algorithm to solve this puzzle automatically, also you can make analysis between the different algorithms according to average time, average assignments, and average constraints checks.
